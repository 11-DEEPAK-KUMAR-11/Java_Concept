Briefly explain the difference between Early and Late Binding with examples.
Answer-

early binding vs late binding:
------------------------------

binding : connecting the method body with method call is known as binding.

1).if it is decided at compile time then it is known as early binding(method overloading
or static polymorphism).

2).if it is decided by the jvm at runtime then it is known as late binding (method overriding or dynamic polymorphism).


Student.java:
-------------

package com.masai;

public class Student {
	
	private int roll;
	private String name;
	private int marks;
	

	public Student() {
		
	}


	public Student(int roll, String name, int marks) {
		super();
		this.roll = roll;
		this.name = name;
		this.marks = marks;
	}
	
	
	
	public int getRoll() {
		return roll;
	}
	public void setRoll(int roll) {
		this.roll = roll;
	}
	
	
	public String getName() {
		return name;
	}
	public void setName(String name) {
		this.name = name;
	}
	
	public int getMarks() {
		return marks;
	}
	
	public void setMarks(int marks) {
		this.marks = marks;
	}


	@Override
	public String toString() {
		return "Student [roll=" + roll + ", name=" + name + ", marks=" + marks + "]";
	}

}
