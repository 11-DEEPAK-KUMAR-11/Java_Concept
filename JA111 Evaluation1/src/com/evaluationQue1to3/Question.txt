Q1) Explain why Java is platform independent ?
Answer-
      Java is platform independent because of bytecode or .class file. whenever we write program
      code then it passes through compiler by writing command javac FileName then compiler convert 
      this program code into bytecode or .class file and this file is platform independent it can be
      executed by the any Operating system like Mac,windows, linux etc. 
      hence we can generate .class file from any OS then this code run in any Operating system 
      this features makes java Platform independent.
